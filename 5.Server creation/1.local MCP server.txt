MCP is a protocol ===== set of rules

1. complex   :: bringing all protocols and rules and build a server is a complex task
2. Redundant :: Suppose if we want to create 2 server , to do that we have to repeat same set of rules which is not a sign of a good programmer 

Two libraries to build MCP server 
    1. MCP SDk 
    2. FastMCP


1. Birth of MCP ( 2023 - 2014)
        . Anthropic introduces Model Context protocol ( MCP )
        . Structured communication between LLMs and external tools and data

        -> Early needs :
                . Build MCP servers (tools/resources/prompts)
                . Build MCP client (app consuming these servers )
        
        -> official Python SDK 
                . mcp.server ---> build servers 
                . mcp.client ---> build clients
                . mcp.cli    ---> CLI for debugging/testing
        
        these becomes the reference of implementation

    
2. Developer Friction & FastMCP 1.x ( 2024 )
        -> problem  :: Raw SDK = verbose and boiler plate heavy 
                . manual list_tools, call_tools, list_prompts etc...
                . explicit schema definition required
                . see for code in SDK_code.py file in same folder . code is too heavy for a simple task and its not a beginner friendly task
        
        -> Solution :: FastMCP helper inside SDK (mcp.server.fastmcp)
        -> Decoder-driven , Type hint answer 
         code ::
                from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
                mcp = FastMCP()
                @mcp.tool()
                def add(a:int,b:int) -> int:
                        return a+b 
                
        -> popular for teaching and prototyping 


3. FastMCP breaks out ( 2025 )
        -> FastMCP adoption grown rapidly 
        -> SDK maintainers goals 
                . Keep SDK minimal and specs focused
                . Let FastMCP evolve faster ( QoL, APIs, transports, Integrations )
        
        -> FastMCP 2.x released as a standalone package 
                pip install fastmcp        ( this wil download only fastmcp not SDK )
                from fastmcp import FastMCP
                mcp = FastMCP()
        
        -> Highly compatable with 1.x but may diverge over time 


5. Where things stand ( late 2025 )
        -> MCP SDK ( mcp )
                . official spec-compliance , stable
                . install : pip install mcp[cli]
        
        -> MCP CLI ( mcp )
                . ships with SDK 
                . Inspect, debug and test servers 

        -> FastMCP 2.x ( fastmcp )
                . Standalone , community driven , fast evolving 
                . ideal for students , educators, standard prototypes
                . Not officialreference but more ergonomic
