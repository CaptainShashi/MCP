APPROACH -- 1.

    1. Simplest Version
        Host  and Server 
            Host ( like chatbot ) - where a user interacts
            Server ( where you want data from )  ex : GitHub , Slcak , Drive , etc

        example ::
            suppose a user asks a question( Are there any commits on my GitHub ) to Host  --->Host ask LLM --> LLM dont know the answer it says " i dont know the answer go and ask github" ---->Host asks github -----> github looks at comits and send a list of commits back to Host -------> Host passes the list of commits passed bu github back to LLM ----> LLM provides response again back to Host ---> user see it 


But in reality Host doesn't directly connect with Server  it require a Client 

APPROACH --2. INCLUDING A CLIENT 

    user ask ("Are there any commits on my GitHub ") to Host ---> Host prepares a highlevel request ---> Host passes the request to Client --> client converts this highlevel request to MCP compatable request and send to server ---> Server provides a structures MCP response to Client ----> Client translate the response into a understandable language to Host

    --> Client and Server has one on one relation 
        i.e one client can connects to one server 
            Suppose if the Host need different server there should be an extra Client and so on..

     Benefits ::
        1. De-coupling :: Seperation of concerns . each server has seperate and independed response to another server ( safety mattered )
        2. Parallelism :: Seperate parallel task can be done at a time as different client with different server 
        3. scalability :: we can connect with any no of servers with a single host
