 2. Resources
 3. Prompts


MCP  PREMITIVES
     
1. Tools     :: Actions that an AI ask the server to perform
2. Resources :: structured data sources that the AI can read 
3. Prompts   :: predefined prompt templates or instructions that a server offers to help shape the AI's behaviour


MCP DATA LAYERS 

data layer ::  the data layer is the language and grammer of theMCP ecosystem that everyobe agrees upon to communicate 

in MCP , JSON RPC 2.0 server as the foundation of data layers 



JSON RPC 2.0  :: JavaScript Object Notation Remote Procedure Call 

--> RPC ( a Remote Procedure Call ) :: allows a programme to execute a function on another computer as if it were local 
                                    hiding the details of network communications and data transfer. this obstruction makes it easier to build 
                                    distributed applications

                                    ex :: Instead of writing add(2,3) locally you can send a request to a server saying "please run add with parameters 2 and 3


---> JSON RPC :: combines the concepts of remote procedure calls with the Simplifying of JSON, Allowing develoopers to structures RPC requests and response in a structured JSON format


               JSON

 --> Request structure
  {                                                                         id for matching both request and response 
    "jsonrpc" : "2.0",
    "method"  : "add",
    "params"  : [2,3],
    "id"      : 1
  }

 
 --> Response structure
 {
    "jsonrpc" : "2.0",
    "result"  : 5,
    "id"      : 1
 }

 ### If method doesnt matching then we get the response as 
 {
    "jsonrpc" : "2.0",
    "error"   : {
        "code"    : -32600,
        "message" : "Method not found"
    },
    "id"      : 1
 }


 ##########  why JSON RPC  for Data Layers ::

 1. Light weight :: in normal Rest api if we try calling another system function from our system we need to call it usin HTTP request , in HTTP request there is a lot of metadata involved so its time taking and costly
                    JSON RPC is easy maintained , easy written 

 2. Bi Directional communication ::Rest API is one way communication but JSON RPC is bidirectional you can also sent request from server to client and client to server 

 3. Transport Agnostic :: Rest api HTTP needed , in JSON RPC its flexible for HTTP, stdio,websockets  we can even create custom one 

 4. Supports batching  :: Rest API one request at a time 
                          We cam send multiple request to server
 5. Supports Notification :: Rest API dont support notification
                             JSON RPC can support Notification



##################  MCP transport Layer
--> The transport layer is the mechanism that moves JSON-RPC messages between Client and Server
    The choice of transfer depends on the type of server
