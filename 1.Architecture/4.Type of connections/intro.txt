Type of connections ::
    using config file   --- like json
    using connectors


Q). what are connectors ? 
        --> A connector is a built in feature that links Claude to MCP server automatically, without the need of manual setup or configuration
             ( dont need to edit in any configuration file )

        --> Most Claude desktop users are non technical end users who just want Claude to "talk" to their apps like drive,slack,githu etc...
        --> they dont want to run servers , edit JSON or worry about transports
        --> the connector system wraps an MCP server behind the scenes and handle authentication via OAuth 
        --> they make things easy, safe and consistant 

        --> think of connector as "APP store" for MCP server - user friendly , click based , pre curated 


Q) Why not using connectors always instead of JSON editing ?
        1. Connectors are curated and managed 
               - connectors are officially built, hosted and maintained by Anthropic 
               - its impossible to make connectors for everything thats why Anthropic made for very few important one like Gmail , Slack , Drive
               - they come with OAuth login flows, managed security , rate limits and guarenteed security 
               - if every MCP server would require to be a connector, it would mean Anthropic has to review, host and maintain every possible server - which doesnt scale 
        
        2. MCP is open standard
               - MCP is designed so anyone can write a server 
               - Forcing everything to connectors would close the ecosystem and make you dependent on Anthropic to approve or publish servers
            ( in simple ):: every connectors you create that has to be reviewed by Anthropic team which is a dependent on Anthropic, so that is why we use both connectors and JSON edit mostly
